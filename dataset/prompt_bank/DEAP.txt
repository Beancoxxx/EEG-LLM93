Dataset Description:
The DEAP dataset contains 32-channel EEG signals recorded from participants experiencing emotional stimuli through music videos. Participants rated each video on continuous scales of valence (negative to positive) and arousal (calm to excited).

Task Instruction:
This is a binary emotion classification task. Analyze the EEG signal patterns to determine whether the participant is experiencing positive (high valence) or negative (low valence) emotional states.

EEG Channel Configuration:
- 32 channels following the International 10-20 system
- Frontal channels (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, Fz): Associated with emotional processing and executive control
- Central channels (C3, C4, Cz): Related to sensorimotor integration
- Parietal channels (P3, P4, P7, P8, Pz): Involved in attention and spatial processing
- Occipital channels (O1, O2): Visual processing areas
- Temporal channels (T7, T8): Auditory and memory processing

Emotion-Related EEG Patterns:
Positive Emotions (High Valence):
- Increased left frontal alpha power (8-13 Hz) relative to right frontal
- Enhanced gamma band activity (30-45 Hz) in frontal regions
- Higher beta power (13-30 Hz) indicating active cognitive engagement
- Frontal alpha asymmetry index: {frontal_alpha_asymmetry}
- Greater coherence between frontal and parietal regions

Negative Emotions (Low Valence):
- Increased right frontal alpha activity
- Reduced overall gamma power
- Enhanced theta activity (4-8 Hz) in frontal and central regions
- Lower beta/alpha ratio
- Increased delta power (0.5-4 Hz) in some cases

Key Features to Analyze:
- Power spectral density in each frequency band: {psd_features}
- Frontal asymmetry patterns: {asymmetry_features}
- Inter-channel coherence: {coherence_features}
- Temporal dynamics and transitions
- Signal complexity and entropy: {entropy_features}

Input Format:
- Sampling rate: 128 Hz
- Sequence length: {seq_len} samples
- Each sample represents multi-channel EEG measurements at a specific time point

SEED promptï¼š
Dataset Description:
The SEED dataset contains 62-channel EEG signals recorded during emotion elicitation using carefully selected film clips. The dataset targets three distinct emotional states: positive (happiness), neutral, and negative (sadness/fear).

Task Instruction:
This is a three-class emotion classification task. Analyze the comprehensive EEG signal patterns to classify the participant's emotional state into one of three categories: positive, neutral, or negative.

EEG Channel Configuration:
- 62 channels with extended 10-20 montage providing high spatial resolution
- Prefrontal channels (Fp1, Fp2, AFz, AF3, AF4): Executive control and emotion regulation
- Frontal channels (F1-F8, Fz, FCz): Emotional processing and motor planning
- Central channels (C1-C6, Cz, CPz): Sensorimotor integration
- Parietal channels (P1-P8, Pz, POz): Attention and spatial awareness
- Occipital channels (O1, O2, Oz): Visual processing
- Temporal channels (T7, T8, TP7, TP8, FT7, FT8): Auditory and memory

Emotion-Specific EEG Signatures:
Positive Emotions (Happiness):
- Significantly increased gamma power (30-50 Hz) in left temporal and frontal regions
- Enhanced beta activity (14-30 Hz) across frontal cortex
- Characteristic frontal alpha asymmetry (left < right)
- High-frequency oscillations in temporal-parietal networks
- Increased connectivity between frontal and temporal regions: {frontal_temporal_connectivity}
- Gamma band power ratio: {gamma_power_ratio}

Neutral State:
- Balanced alpha power (8-13 Hz) between hemispheres
- Moderate beta activity without significant lateralization
- Lower gamma power compared to emotional states
- Stable theta rhythms (4-8 Hz) in frontal-central areas
- Reduced long-range connectivity
- Alpha symmetry index: {alpha_symmetry_index}

Negative Emotions (Sadness/Fear):
- Increased right frontal and temporal alpha power
- Enhanced theta activity in frontal and central regions
- Reduced gamma power, especially in left hemisphere
- Increased delta power (1-4 Hz) in frontal areas
- Greater alpha-theta coupling
- Heightened connectivity in right hemisphere networks
- Theta/beta ratio: {theta_beta_ratio}

Critical Analysis Points:
- Differential entropy features across bands: {de_features}
- Hemispheric power asymmetry: {hemispheric_asymmetry}
- Phase-locking values between regions: {plv_features}
- Spectral power distribution: {spectral_distribution}
- Temporal evolution of emotional patterns
- Cross-frequency coupling: {cfc_features}

Input Format:
- Sampling rate: 200 Hz (downsampled from 1000 Hz)
- Sequence length: {seq_len} samples
- Higher sampling rate captures fast gamma oscillations
- Each time point contains 62-channel simultaneous recordings
